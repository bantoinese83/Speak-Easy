# Contributing to Speak-Easy

Thank you for considering contributing! To keep the codebase readable and maintainable, please follow these guidelines:

## Code Style

- **Descriptive Naming:** Use clear, intention-revealing names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Concise Code:** Strive for simplicity. Avoid unnecessary complexity and deep nesting.
- **Meaningful Comments:** Add comments only where logic is non-obvious or intent needs clarification. Prefer JSDoc for public APIs.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Use Prettier and ESLint. Run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before submitting PRs.
- **Small Functions/Classes:** Break down complex logic into small, focused functions and classes with a single responsibility.
- **DRY Principle:** Extract repeated logic into reusable helpers or modules.

## Code Review

- All PRs should be reviewed for readability, maintainability, and adherence to these guidelines.
- Use descriptive commit messages and PR titles.
- Automated checks (lint, format) must pass before merge.
